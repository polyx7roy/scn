# Silverbyph TRC20 Token

## Description

This repository contains the TRC20 token contract for Silverbyph, a unique digital asset backed by physical silver bullion coins minted by Silverbyph and securely stored in our vault provider. Each Silverbyph token represents ownership and serves as a receipt for an equivalent amount of silver bullion coins in the vault, enabling the holder to claim the physical silver at any time.

## Features

- Each token is backed by a corresponding amount of silver bullion coins stored in a secure vault.
- Token holders have proof of ownership and can request delivery of their silver bullion coins.
- Tokens are implemented as a TRC20 token on the TRON network, enabling fast and efficient transactions.

## Disclaimer

This token represents ownership of physical silver stored in a secure vault. However, token holders are responsible for their own security. Please be careful with your private keys and always use secure wallets.

The Silverbyph token does not represent a share or stake in Silverbyph, it does not grant the holder voting rights, and it does not pay dividends or other returns. Thus, it does not act as a form of security. Furthermore, the token acts as an integral component of our Know Your Customer (KYC) process. All token holders must comply with our KYC procedures. Non-compliance may result in access to certain functionalities of the token being limited or revoked.
